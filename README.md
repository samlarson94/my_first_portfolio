# my_first_portfolio

- Worked on laying out all components using CSS Grid and CSS flexbox, starting with upper header and nav bar and then working my way towards the bottom of the page
- Reserved links for future portfolio projects, added live links to contact-me section
- Used ID's and links to link different sections of the page to their headings in the nav bar
- Used media querie to create an ipad-friendly version of the site using 'max-width'.  CSS incorporates flex-box, so this sizing works with smaller phone sizes as well.
- Used box shadow and margins to make sections feel unique and interesting.
- Added desciptive title

# Future work to be done
- Build out projects and link them to site
- Add additional media queries as needed
